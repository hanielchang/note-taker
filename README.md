# Note Taker Application

## Description

This is a simple note-taker application. It allows the user to create a note with a title and text description.
When both fields (title and text) are filled, a save button appears which allows the user to save the note. 
Once saved, the note will display on the left hand side on a list. The user may click on the note to re-open 
the title and text description on the right side of the application.
